# buttontask

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

 <h2>1. What is  Asynchronous Programming?</h2>
 <h3>Asynchronous programming is a programming paradigm that allows tasks or operations to run independently and concurrently, without waiting for each other to complete before moving on to the next task.</h3>
 <h2>2.What is Future Class ?</h2>
 <h2>the Future class represents a future result of an asynchronous computation. This result will eventually appear in the Future after the processing is complete. </h2>
  <h2>3.What is Duration class & Future.delayed() constructor with Example ?</h2>
 <h2>delayed takes two parameters, duration and computation. The Future executes the computation function after a specified duration as we mentioned before. </h2>
 <h2>4.What is the Use of the async & await keyword ?</h2>
 <h3>The async keyword transforms a regular JavaScript function into an asynchronous function, causing it to return a Promise. The await keyword is used inside an async function to pause its execution and wait for a Promise to resolve before continuing </h3>
 <h2>5.What is Recursion ? With Example.</h2>
 <h3>The recursion process in C refers to the process in which the program repeats a certain section of code in a similar way. Thus, in the programming languages, when the program allows the user to call any function inside the very same function, </h3>
 <h2>6.What is Timer class with example ?</h2>
 <h3>In the world of Flutter, time is of the essence, and the Timer class is the cornerstone of managing time-related functions within your app. This class provides an abstract interface for implementing timers that can be set to trigger once or to repeat at regular intervals, </h3>
 <h2>7.What is Timer.periodic and use with Example?</h2>
 <h3>Periodic timers stay alive until they are manually canceled. Flutter has a different factory method, named periodic , to create such a timer. A good example of a periodic timer is displaying the remaining time for a time-sensitive operation, like completing a payment within 10 minutes. </h3>
